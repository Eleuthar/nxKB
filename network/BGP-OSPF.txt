Autonomous System (AS)
```````````````````````
* A network of routers using the same logic and policy owned by a single entity (company\ISP\government) aka backbone of the internet

* Each AS is granted a unique AS number by IANA - a unique 16-bit number
(~100k globally)

* Each AS has interior routers and an ASBR (border router) that hold a list of paths to other AS.

* Each AS is segmented into Areas connected to each other via Area Border Routers acting as a bridge.

* Interior routers are subjected to IGP (internal gateway protocol) and EGP (exterior routing protocol)

* DR (Designated Router) exchanges info with other area routers via LSA 
	\\ New router joins an AS & sends LSA (Link State Advertisements)

* IGP use:
	\\ Distance Vector = RIPv1, RIPv2, IGRP
	\\ Link State = OSPF, IS-IS (intermediate system)
	\\ Hybrid = EIGRP

* EGP use:
	\\ Path Vector = BGP
