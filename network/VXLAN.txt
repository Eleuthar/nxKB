EVPN uses BGP routes to enable MAC learning & advertisement (within control plane - how data is) like it would handle routing tables, to enable load balancing between EVPN routes with the same MAC destination but different next hops.

VXLAN replaces directly connected trunk links with VTEP UDP tunnels (VXLAN tunnel endpoint) that provide similar functionality, based on an interior routing protocol - OSPF.

UDP is used to support ECMP (equal cost multi-path routing) to increase bandwidth by loadbalancing traffic over multiple paths.

VTEP tunnel permits broadcasting based on VNID (virtual network ID) - a LAN connected by VTEP - by VXLAN bridging.
