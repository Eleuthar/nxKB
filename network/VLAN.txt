Logical segmentation of a broadcast domain without using physical devices like router || multilayer switch



STATIC VS DYNAMIC
``````````````````
STATIC VLAN = port based

DYNAMIC VLAN = MAC (or even IP) address based
	\\ requires a central server = VLAN Member Policy Server (VMPS)
	\\ VMPS holds the MAC - VLAN mapping

Trunking (tagging < non-CISCO) permits traversing traffic between physical switches \ VLANs via trunk port which expects tagged traffic.

Tag frame holds VLAN Identifier ranged 1-4094.



Default vs Native
``````````````````
DEFAULT - VLAN 1 
	\\ is mapped to an access port not assigned to any VLAN
	\\ cannot be deleted\changed

NATIVE
	\\ traffic traverses trunk without tag
	\\ default native is VLAN 1 but can be changed
	\\ should be the same on both trunk ends



VLAN Trunking Protocol
```````````````````````
VTP servers synchronize VLAN configurations of switches based on VTP Domain.
Can send summary advertisements every 5 minutes by default.
VTP Pruning prevent unnecessary traffic toward non-concerned switches.
