 ~ syslogd
	\\ application logs
	
	
~ klogd
	\\ kernel logs
	

/var/logs
	\\ contains a set of log files:
		* cron = log generated when cron execute
		* mail = log related to mail
		* messages = all logs except auth, cron, mail & news
		* secure = log all failed auth, user added\deleted


/etc/syslog.conf

# pkill -HUP syslogd
	\\ re-read daemon conf
	
	
	
RULE FORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

facility.level			action

Facility = [auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp, local0..7]
	\\ local0..7 used to create custom log files
	
Level = [debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, emerg, non, *]

Action = [append to file "/path/to/file", write to device "/dev/console", forward to remote host "@hostname", write to user "username"]



CENTRAL LOGGING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~	@hostname is used to forward logs to central server, due to security reasons; sender host must contain in /etc/services or /etc/sysconfig : "syslog 514/udp"

~	on the remote host, the syslog start-up script must contain the "-r" flag to receive messages on UDP port 514



LOGGER
~~~~~~~~

# logger "text" 
	\\ send default user.notice priority message to /var/log/messages
	\\ -p can modify priority, but only if conf is edited to handle the logger priority
