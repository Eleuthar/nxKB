tcpdump -i any -c 5 -n -s96 "host $IP \

	\\ listen all interfaces to port 80
	\\ -c = packet count
	\\ -n = prevent DNS resolution
	\\ -s = set maximum packet size to 96 byte

tcpdump -i eth0 ether host $MAC -n -e

	\\ capture only to OR from this MAC
	\\ -e = view MAC in capture, default not visible

	\\ capture only SYN flag
	\\ same applies to all other flag
	\\ ASCII data



TCP flag
`````````````
	- SYN = only the 1st packet from sender\receiver should have this flag

	- Urgent Pointer = deliver data out of sequence immediately

	- ACK = packet received by client, must contain an valid acknowledgement number

	- PUSH = immediately send segment to network layer when received signal from app layer, instead of buffering until it reaches maximum segment size

	- RST (reset) = terminate connection if faulty TCP connection OR unexpected conversation

	- FIN = connection termination sent by sender




ANALYSIS
```````````
wscale = 7 aka 2^7; win value multiplied with wscale

-t = remove timestamp

-ttt = time diff between consecutive output; @spike

-ttttt = time from the 1st packet; @overall transaction
